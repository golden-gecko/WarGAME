* weapons

	+ types
		- convencional
		- energetic
		- flame

	+ material has 'factor' (how much damage unit get) for each weapon type

* units

	+ each unit has 'hit points' (depends on parts used to build unit)
		- unit with higher HP will fight much longer

	+ if unit is damaged
		- HP below 70% unit skills decrease
		- HP below 80% unit can only move (good time for retreat)
		- HP below 90% unit cannot even move

	+ experience
		- each damaged and killed enemy unit gives little experience bonus
		- more XP means better aiming, little damage bonus, avoiding missiles (not sure, hard to implement)
		- ranks

	+ statistics
		- travelled distance
		- kills, damage given or taken, fired missiles

* unit parts

	+ each part has material type
		- has weight (less weight means higher speed)
		- has durability (more durability means higher costs)
		- has cost (how much resources we need to built unit)

	+ body
		- different types (extra light, light, medium, heavy, extra heavy)

	+ chassis
		- different types (ground, water surface, air, underwater or any combinations)
		- 4 wheel (high speed, low grip, light)
		- 8 wheel (medium speed, medium grip, medium)
		- tracks (low speed, high grip, heavy)
		- amphibious 4 wheel (high speed, low grip, slower and heavier than 4 wheel, but can move on the water surface)
		- amphibious tracks (low speed, high grip, slower and heavier than tracks, but can move on the water surface)

	+ engine
		- has power
		- power describes has fast unit can move (speed depends on unit weight)
		- has basic fuel tank

	+ additional fuel tank
		- has capacity

	+ each weapon has basic ammunition storage

	+ missile (to complex?)
		- two types (basic, with own propulsion)
		- moves straight until hit sth or fall down
		- if has own propulsion, has power (speed depends on weight, can aim near objects, e.g. anti-air rockets)
		- has damage
		- has radius
		- explodes on colision (or maybe after specific time?, e.g. anti-air cannons, time is set by unit)

	+ canon
		- fires missiles straight at target
		- has reload time

	+ mortar
		- fires missiles up (good against targets behind hills or walls)
		- has reload time

	+ rocket
		- has damage
		- has radius
		- has own propulsion (has power, speed depends on weight)
		- explodes on colisions

	+ rocket launching pad
		- fires big rockets

	+ anti-rocket launching pad
		- detects rockets within specific range
		- fires anti-rockets

	+ laser gun
		- has power (how much energy each shot consumes)
		- has recharge time
		- power describes range (in metres), damage (per second), time (how long gun is firing)

	+ flamethrower
		- has pressure
		- pressure describes range (in meters), damage (per second), burning time (in seconds)

	+ additional ammunition storage
		- has capacity

	+ shield generator (force field reducing damage)
		- has power (how much damage can absorb before it turns off)
		- has absorb factor (from 0.0 to 1.0, if 1.0 all damage from missile is absorbed)
		- has recharging time (when overloaded starts to recharge)
		- has radius (can protect other unit, if they are in range)
		- generated at different sides (front, back, left, right, top, bottom or any combinations)

	+ invisibility
		- ???

	+ radar
		- has range
		- detects units and buildings

	+ jammer
		- has range
		-

* resources

	+ can be finite or infinite
	+ can be gathered only in specific points or everywhere

* buildings

	+ resource buildings
		- produces resources
		- give resources all the time or must be placed near some resources (depends on resource type)

	+ factory
		- unit design
		- unit production

	+ walls
		- protects against missiles and unit movement

	+ turrets
		- if is damaged (sth like damaging units)
		- can be composed into walls

* turret parts

	+ body
		- few types (light, medium, heavy)

	+ material type
		- same as unit material

	+ weapon
		- same as unit weapons

	+ shield generator
		- same as unit shield generators
